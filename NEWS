# Version HEAD

* API revamped in order to support `pipes-4.0.0` and `pipes-parse-2.0.0`.

* Added functions that act directly upon `Put` and `Get` monads: `encodePut`,
  `decodeGet`, `decodeGetMany`.

* Decoding functions now report the number of bytes that were consumed in order
  to decode a value.

* Re-export `Get`, `Put`, `Binary` and `ByteOffset` from the `binary` package.


# Version 0.1.0.0

* Initial version.
